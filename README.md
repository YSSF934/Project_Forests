# Project_Forests

In this project students were asked to analyze data for ForestQuery, a non-profit organization on a mission to reduce deforestation around the world and which raises awareness about this important environmental topic.

The executive director and her leadership team members are looking to understand which countries and regions around the world seem to have forests that have been shrinking in size, and also which countries and regions have the most significant forest area, both in terms of amount and percent of total area. The hope is that these findings can help inform initiatives, communications, and personnel allocation to achieve the largest impact with the precious few resources that the organization has at its disposal.

Students were given 3 tables of data dealing with forestation as well as total land area and region groupings.  The tables were loaded into a database and analyzed using SQL queries to answer some of the most important questions in preparation for a meeting with the ForestQuery executive team.
